# Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster with k3d ðŸ˜Ž

This guide will walk you through setting up a Kubernetes cluster using k3d. Make sure you have Docker installed on your system before proceeding.

# Kubernetes Cluster Setup

To set up the Kubernetes cluster along with Gateway API and Kong Ingress Controller, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `k8s` directory.
2. Run the `setup.sh` script.

This script will automatically:

ðŸš€ Install k3d, kubectl, and Helm if not already installed.

ðŸŒŸ Create a k3d cluster named "saga" with port mapping for load balancing.

ðŸŒŸ Install the Gateway API and apply Kong gateway configuration.

ðŸŒŸ Add the Kong Helm repository and update Helm repositories.

ðŸŒŸ Install the Kong Ingress Controller.

After running the script, your Kubernetes cluster will be set up and ready to use with Kong as the Ingress Controller.

## Installing order, stock and payment using Helm ðŸ“Š

After setting up the Kubernetes cluster and installing the Kong Ingress Controller:

1. Use Helm to create the "order", "stock", and "payment" releases using the Saga chart and corresponding values:

   ```bash
   helm install order ./saga --values order/values.yaml
   helm install stock ./saga --values stock/values.yaml
   helm install payment ./saga --values payment/values.yaml
   ```

This creates three Helm releases, "order", "stock", and "payment", with configurations specified in their respective `values.yaml` files.

Please note that each command creates a specific Helm release with its own configurations.
